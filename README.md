# Predicting Heart Disease

### Introduction
The early detection of signs for diseases can give doctors important insights and increase the chances of finding the right diagnosis. In this project we will use random forests and and logistic regression to potentially predict the presence of heart disease, based on a data set made available by the University of California (UCI).

 The `Heart Disease Data Set` is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) or on the [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) of the University of California.
